# Hi! I'm Ewald van Veen.

I am a creative web developer that focuses on front-end techniques such as HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript and Angular. When building websites, accessibility and a structured semantic layout are important aspects I'll always keep in mind.

I have experience in building Web APIs using C#. Because of that I'm able to work together with back-end developers to find the best solution for a problem.

Although working on my own is not an issue, I love to work as part of a team. I like the dynamics of working together towards a specific goal, whereby I have become a fan of Agile methods such as Scrum and Kanban in recent years.
