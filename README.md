# Hi! I'm Ewald van Veen.
## Welcome on my GitHub profile!

I am a creative web developer that focuses on front-end techniques such as HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript and Angular. Accessibility and a basic layout of a website are important topics for me.

I have experience in building Web APIs using C#. Because of that I'm able to work together with back-end developers to find the best solution for a problem.

Although I can work independently without any problems, I prefer to work together in a team. I like the dynamics of working together towards a certain goal, whereby I have become a fan of Agile methods such as Scrum and Kanban in recent years.
