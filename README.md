Hello, I'm Ewald, a creative web&nbsp;developer that focuses on front-end techniques such as HTML, CSS (Sass), JavaScript and Angular. When building websites, accessibility and a structured semantic layout are important aspects I'll always keep in mind.

I have also experience with building Web&nbsp;API's using C#. Because of that I'm able to work together with back-end developers to find the best solution for a specific problem.

I love to work as part of a team. I like the dynamics of working together towards a specific goal, whereby I've become a fan of Agile methods such as Scrum and Kanban in recent years.
